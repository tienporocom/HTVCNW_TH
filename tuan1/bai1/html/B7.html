      A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at
      the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile.
      Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the comer of the eyes,
      an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye
      contraction may be perceived as insincere.
