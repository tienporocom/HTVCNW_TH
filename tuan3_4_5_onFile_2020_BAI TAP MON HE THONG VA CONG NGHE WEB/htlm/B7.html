        for international tribunal</h1>

            Russia has used its veto at
the I-N to block a draft
resolution to set up an
intemational tribunal into
the MHI 7 air disaster in
July 2014. It was the only
nation at the 15-member
UN Security Council to
oppose the move,
triggering widespread
condemnation.
The Malaysian Airlines
flight from Amsteldam to
Kuala Lumpur crashed in
eastern Ukraine. killing all
298 people on board. Pro-
Russian rebels in the area
have denied shooting
down the aircraft. Westem
nations and Ukraine say
there is evidence it was hit
by a Russian-supplied Buk
anti-aircrafr missile - a
claim also denied by
Russia. 'Callous disregard'
Malaysia pushed for an
international tribunal to try
those responsible. The
move was backed by the
Netherlands - which had
196 nationals on board -
Ukraine. Belgium and
Australia. Moscow has
blamed the government in
Kiev for the disaster.
Eleven ofthe 151-N
Security Council members
backed the draft zesolution

tribunal would be
"premature" and "counter-
productive".
